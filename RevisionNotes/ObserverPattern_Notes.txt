Observer Design Pattern: 

-it defines one to many dependency between objects so that when one object state changes , all of its dependents are notified and automaitcally updated
-In this pattern , there are many observers(objects) which are observing a particular subject(object)
-observer register themselves to a subject and are automaitcally notified when the subject changes
