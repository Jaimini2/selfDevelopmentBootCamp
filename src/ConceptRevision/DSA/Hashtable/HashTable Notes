Two common strategies for handling collisison
1) Open addressing
 - If we try to put an employee into table and we find out that there is already an emp at the slot where
 we want to put new emp then we look for another postion in an array ,
 - If we already have the position filled then lets look for another position in an array , thats called open addressing
 -There are diff ways that we cna look for other positions, we are going to look whats called Linear probing.

 With Linear probing , when we discover that the given position is already occupied then we increment hashedValue by 1 , if hashtable is
 incremented upto its maximum length then we say that it is full and we do not insert the employee into an array

 Always override HashCode when you override equals method
