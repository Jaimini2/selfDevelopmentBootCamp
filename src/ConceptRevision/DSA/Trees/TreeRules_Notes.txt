Basic Rules of a Tree :

-Every item in a tree is a Node
- The node at the top is known as the root Node
-Every non-root node has one and only one parent
-A leaf node has no children
- A Singleton tree has only one node i.e. the root


PATH :
A path is a sequence of node required to go from one Node to another
Important characteristics of trees is you cannot have cyclic path

DEPTH :
depth of a node is the numbe rof edges from the node to the root
So the depth of the root is always zero

Edge :
Each arrow pointing from one node to another is known as edge.
Arrow always points from the parent to the child.

HEIGHT:
A height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path from the node to  leaf.
Leaf node will have a height of zero.
The no of edges on the path to get from a leaf node to leaf node is zero.
So leaf node will always have a height of zero.


The height of a tree is the height of its root Node because obviosuly the longest path from the root to a leaf node
is going to be the height of a root node.

LEVEL OF A TREE:
Level of a tree contains all the nodes that are at the same depth
