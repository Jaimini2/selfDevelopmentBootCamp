Heaps :
-A complete Binary tree
-Must satisfy the heap property
Max Heap : Every parent is greater than or equal to its children
Min Heap : Every parent is less than or equal to its children

Rules  :
-A binary heap must be a complete tree
-Children are added at each level from left to right
-Usually implemented as arrays
-The maximum or minimum value will always be at the root of the tree-the advantage of using heap

-HEAPIFY:
process of converting a binary tree into a heap
-this often has to be done after insertion or deletion
-No required ordering between siblings

HEAPS : DELETE
-Fix Heap Above -same as insert , swap replacement value with parent
-Fix Heap Below - swap the replacement value with the larger of its two children
-Rinse and Repeat in both the cases until the replacement value is in its current position
-will only need to fix up or down but not both
